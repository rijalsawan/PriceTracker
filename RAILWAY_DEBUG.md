# 🚨 CRITICAL: Railway Service Not Responding

## Immediate Actions:

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
- Go to: https://railway.app
- Select your project → Backend service
- Check status: Should show "Deployed" (green)
- If showing "Failed" or "Building", click to see error logs

### 2. Required Environment Variables
Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Variables

**Add these IMMEDIATELY:**

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-make-it-very-long-and-secure-123456789
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
FRONTEND_URL=https://price-tracker-murex.vercel.app
```

### 3. Database Setup Issue
If service is running but database fails, run this in Railway terminal:

```bash
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
```

### 4. Check Logs for These Common Errors:

❌ **"JWT_SECRET is required"** → Add JWT_SECRET variable
❌ **"Database connection failed"** → Run Prisma DB push
❌ **"Port already in use"** → Railway will handle this
❌ **"Module not found"** → Build failed, check package.json

### 5. Quick Fix - Redeploy
After adding environment variables:
1. Railway → Settings → General
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Check logs for success/errors

## Expected Success Logs:
```
✅ Database connected successfully
✅ Database tables exist  
🚀 Server running on port 8080
```
